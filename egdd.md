# Game Nam

A calculated assualt (working title)

## Elevator Pitch

You are introduced to a region in turmoil and you are directed to help. To do so you need to use the numbers/citizens of the region. However, not all citizens have the required numbers. Using provided resources you are to judiciously contruct towers/buildings which will be able to change the numbers and save the day!

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*

## Influences (Brief)

- Kingdom Rush: 
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: Kingdom Rush is a tower defense game, which requires the player to use towers in unique ways to advance through each       level.
  
- *Influence #2*:
  - Medium: *(Television, Games, Literature, Movies, etc.)*
  - Explanation: *In one paragraph or less, explain why this is an influence.*
- *Influence #3*:
  - Medium: *(Television, Games, Literature, Movies, etc.)*
  - Explanation: *In one paragraph or less, explain why this is an influence.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- Provide the correct numbers for the goal by using the tower abilities.
- Win the level by meeting the goal(s) requirements.
- Fail level by missing the goal(s) requirements.
- Advance to next level or choose to repeat after winning.
- Repeat level after failing.
- After completeing all levels get a victory screen.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Algebra
(maybe this should be lower/higher level than algebra)

*Briefly list any and all of the disciplines and learning domains for this subject.*

## Target Audiences
 - Students being introduced to algebra.
 - Should be appropriate for young kids and adults who enjoy tower defense       games.

## Target Contexts

 - To be used as a supplementary form of practice for course teaching         algebra.Good free time activity for kids k-12.

## Learning Objectives 

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

 - By the end of the lesson. players will be able to solve simple algebraic   problems.
 
- *Short Name*: *Formal Learning Objective #2*
- *Short Name*: *Formal Learning Objective #3*

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Basic math skills starting at knowledge of addition and multiplication
- *Prerequisite Learning Objective #2*

## Assessment Measures

*Describe how the learning will be assessed, e.g., pre/post multiple-choice test, or SAT, or some other instrument.*

 Open response or multiple chioce algebra test. (*Perhaps should specify solve for unknown type problems*).

  - Given complex algebra problem, should be able to solve in open response format.
  - Given simple algebra problems, should be able to solve in mulitple choice format.
 

*If proposing a new instrument, briefly and concisely list some example assessment questions.*

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- Inolves higher level of strategy, which demand deep understanding of algebra.
- *Reason #2*
- *Reason #3*
- *Reason #4*
- *etc.*

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

Players set up towers on the perimeter of a course. The numbers/citizens of the region/level flow through the course. 

or

This is a single player game, with click and drag mechanics using the mouse or touchscreen.

## Player Modes

*Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.*

- Single player: advance through rounds & levels until the end is reached.

# Gameplay Objectives

- Satisfy goal requirements during the round:
    - Description: Make sure correct numbers go to correct goals
    - Alignment: This allows the player to treat each number coming into the field like a varible they have to modify.
  
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

# Objects/Entities

*What other things are in the world that you need to design? These may or may not directly translate to actual objects and classes.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #1*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #2*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #3*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*

    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
